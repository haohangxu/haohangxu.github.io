Yet I often find myself assuming that if someone was once comfortable taking on some risk, then they will always be comfortable taking on that risk!
It&amp;rsquo;s always hard to decline an invite,1 especially so when you feel like you have to justify a change in behavior. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to combat this bias and be more kind by always offering an easy out and explicity leaving space in every invitation for others to voice their discomfort.</description></item><item><title>Hugo</title><link>https://haohangxu.github.io/posts/2021-09-25-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://haohangxu.github.io/posts/2021-09-25-hugo/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s storytime! I&amp;rsquo;m switching to Hugo!
Prologue: Installing Hugo So I open up the Hugo installation page, Ctrl-f-ed for &amp;ldquo;Ubuntu&amp;rdquo;, saw that it was available via apt, and installed it.
Everything goes smoothly, and moving over my (very little) content was super easy. I mostly abandon my old theme and cobble something new together based on the Gokarna theme.
Awesome! The migration is basically done!
