---

Hi! My name is Haohang. I'm a senior at Yale University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. 

Things I like:
- derping
- board games
- puns
- puzzles
- squishables, like plushies and cats
- enumerable sets 

Things I don't like:
- scary movies
- heights
- C++
- granola
- socks

Things that currently occupy my time:
- homework
- sleep
- trying to understand the world

Further enumeration of these sets can potentially be found over in [Words]({{ site.baseurl }}/words), where I intend to contemplate life.
