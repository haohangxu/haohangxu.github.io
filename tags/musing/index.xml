Yet I often find myself assuming that if someone was once comfortable taking on some risk, then they will always be comfortable taking on that risk!
It&amp;rsquo;s always hard to decline an invite,1 especially so when you feel like you have to justify a change in behavior. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to combat this bias and be more kind by always offering an easy out and explicity leaving space in every invitation for others to voice their discomfort.</description></item></channel></rss>
