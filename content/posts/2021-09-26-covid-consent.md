My own risk tolerance for social gatherings has changed a lot throughout the last year and a half. Yet I often find myself assuming that if someone was once comfortable taking on some risk, then they will always be comfortable taking on that risk!

It's always hard to decline an invite,[^1] especially so when you feel like you have to justify a change in behavior. I'm trying to combat this bias and be more kind by always offering an easy out and explicity leaving space in every invitation for others to voice their discomfort.
