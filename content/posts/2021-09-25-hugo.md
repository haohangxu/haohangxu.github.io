I'm switching to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)! Things are going mostly smooth so far.

Here's a story of mistakes I made while getting things set up.

### Prologue: Installing Hugo

So I open up the [Hugo installation page](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/), Ctrl-f-ed for "Ubuntu", saw that it was available via apt, and installed it. Everything goes smoothly, and migrating my (very little) content was super easy. Awesome! No problem! (Narrator: ...or so she thought.)

### Chapter 1: Deploying to GitHub Pages

I was previously using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), whose developer, [Tom Preston-Warner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner), was a founder of GitHub. As expected, deploying my Jekyll site to GitHub was a breeze.

I figure I'd just swap out Jekyll with Hugo and continue using GitHub pages. After all, Hugo's website even had a [nice little guide](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) for hosting on GitHub!

So I try running `hugo --minify`, and Hugo kindly tells me that it knows of no such flag. What?

Well, turns out I should've read a little bit more from the Hugo installation page:

> This option is not recommended because the Hugo in Linux package managers for Debian and Ubuntu is usually a few versions behind as described [here](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/703).

Welp.

### Chapter 2: Installing Hugo, Part 2

Ok then I try the script [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#fetch-from-github) for installing Hugo from source. At first things are chugging along, but then:

```bash
$ go install --tags extended

Command 'go' not found, but can be installed with:

sudo apt install golang-go
sudo apt install gccgo-go 
```

Um. Turns out I don't even have go installed (???). *facepalm*

### Chapter 3: Installing Go

Bash so kindly told me exactly how to install Go, so I go (haha) ahead and run `sudo apt install golang-go`. 

That succeeds, and in a stroke of brilliance, I remember that the Hugo docs mentioned requiring Go 1.11, so I check the version:

```bash
$ go version
go version go1.10.4 linux/amd64 
```

Gahhh!

### Chapter 4: Installing Go, Part 2

So turns out the moral of the story is that apt sucks. This is not the first story with that moral.

I [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install). I fiddle around with versioning before successfully uninstalling `go1.10`.

### Chapter 5: Installing Hugo, Part 3

Are you sick of this story yet? 

Anyway I must've gotten my environment messed up somehow, because the `go install` still did nothing, so I finally ended up installing the Debian package directly:

```bash
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.88.1/hugo_0.88.1_Linux-64bit.deb
dpkg -i hugo_0.88.1_Linux-64bit.deb
```

I check the version:

```bash
$ hugo version
hugo v0.88.1-5BC54738 linux/amd64 BuildDate=2021-09-04T09:39:19Z VendorInfo=gohugoio 
```

And `hugo --minify` works like a charm. Phew!
