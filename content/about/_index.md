## Hey! I'm Haohang.

I'm currently a software developer in the NYC area.

### Things I like:
+ puns
+ puzzles
+ plants
+ squishables (plushies, cats, etc)
+ enumerable sets

### Things I don't like:
+ scary movies
+ cilantro
+ heights
+ camel-case
+ socks

### Things that occupy my time:
+ derping
+ teaching tricks to my cat
+ trying to understand the world

Further enumeration of these sets may be found over in [Posts](/posts/), where I intend to collect contemplations on derping and life.
